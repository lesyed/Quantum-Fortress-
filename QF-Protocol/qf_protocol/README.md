# 🛡️ Quantum Fortress

**A privacy-preserving federated learning prototype with integrity monitoring**

Quantum Fortress is a **deployable demonstration platform** that explores how multiple parties can collaboratively train machine-learning models **without sharing raw data**, while maintaining **basic integrity checks, anomaly detection, and auditability**.

This project is focused on **realistic system design**, not research hype or compliance claims.
